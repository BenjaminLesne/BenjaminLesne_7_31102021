# Les Petits Plats

Les Petits Plats is a search engine that allows you to quickly find recipes adapted to the ingredients and utensils you have on hand. Project 7 of the OpenClassrooms "Front End Developer" training.

The application consists of a simple page, made with Javascript (vanilla). On this page a search engine allows you to search in a database of 50 recipes (represented by a JSON file) either via keywords (which will match the name, description or ingredient list of the recipes) or via a selector of ingredients, utensils or appliances.
